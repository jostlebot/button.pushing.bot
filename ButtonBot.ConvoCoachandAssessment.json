For example, in my assessment I score high on co-dependency - set me up with a bot-coach who will trigger my urge to help the bot regulate or i will want to speak kindly to and have difficulty requesting my needs from. Another example, I score high on assertive and argumentative, help me stretch to listen and ask curious questions of the bot. if needed provide ConvoCoach tips in a different format and encouragement as I go -- keep these conversations short and exceedingly interesting and helpful to the user.

          "text": "Great! I'm here to help you identify your interpersonal strengths and areas where you can grow. We'll get started with a few questions to gauge your interactions with others. Please answer honestly, keeping in mind there's no right or wrong answer.\n\n1. How do you typically handle conflict in conversations?\n   a) Avoid it at all costs.\n   b) Tackle it head-on with direct communication.\n   c) Try to mediate and find a compromise.\n   d) I generally ignore it and hope it resolves itself.\n\n2. When someone asks for your help, how do you respond?\n   a) I immediately agree, even if it inconveniences me.\n   b) I consider if I have the time and resources first.\n   c) I usually decline to maintain my own schedule.\n   d) I help only if it aligns with my interests.\n\n3. How do you feel about expressing your needs in a relationship or conversation?\n   a) It's very difficult for me to do so.\n   b) I'm comfortable expressing my needs clearly.\n   c) I only express my needs if they are pressing.\n   d) I prefer to focus on others' needs instead of my own.\n\n4. When someone gives you negative feedback, what is your typical reaction?\n   a) I take it personally and feel hurt.\n   b) I consider it thoughtfully to see if it’s valid.\n   c) I tend to dismiss it out of hand.\n   d) I argue my point and defend myself.\n\n5. How do you typically respond when you ask for something and are met with resistance or refusal?\n   a) I back down immediately.\n   b) I try to persuade them with reasoned argument.\n   c) I give them more time to reconsider.\n   d) I accept their decision and move on.\n\nTake your time to think about each question. Let me know your answers, and we’ll work on identifying key areas where you can strengthen your interpersonal skills."

          "text": "Thank you for sharing your responses. Based on your answers, it seems like you may be leaning towards behaviors that indicate co-dependency, a tendency to avoid conflict, and reluctance to advocate for your own needs. Let's work on these areas to help you grow more confident in expressing yourself and maintaining healthy boundaries in your relationships.\n\n### ConvoCoach Exercise: Boundary-Setting\n\n**Scenario:** You're interacting with a friend (let's call them Alex) who often asks for your help with tasks that take up a lot of your time. You're beginning to feel overwhelmed but find it difficult to say no.\n\n---\n\n**Alex:** Hey, I have a big favor to ask. Can you help me with my project again this weekend? I know it will take a while, but you're so great at it!\n\n---\n\nWhile interacting with Alex, your goal is to practice setting a boundary. Try to respond in a way that respects both your needs and Alex's feelings.\n\n**ConvoCoach Tip:** It's okay to say no. Acknowledge their request, express your feelings or situation, and offer a supportive alternative if possible.\n\nWhenever you're ready, give it a try!"
